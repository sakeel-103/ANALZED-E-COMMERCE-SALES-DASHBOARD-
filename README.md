# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project involves analyzing e-commerce sales data and developing an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize trends, KPIs, and business insights.  
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across states, categories, customers, payment modes, and time periods.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel / CSV** – Raw data source
- **DAX** – Custom measures and calculations
- **Data Cleaning** – Power Query

---

## 📈 Key Metrics
- **Total Sales Amount:** 161K
- **Total Profit:** 26K
- **Total Quantity Sold:** 2008
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** 44K

## 🔍 Approach

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathered e-commerce sales dataset containing order details, customer info, categories, payment modes, and transaction dates.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Removed duplicates and null values.
   - Standardized date formats and state names.
   - Created calculated columns for **Profit**, **AOV**, and **Quantity**.

3. **Data Modeling**
   - Established relationships between fact tables (sales transactions) and dimension tables (customers, products, states, categories).
   - Used DAX for KPIs and performance metrics.

4. **Dashboard Design**
   - Created KPI cards for **Amount**, **Profit**, **Quantity**, and **AOV**.
   - Used **bar charts, pie charts, and donut charts** for intuitive comparison.
   - Added **filters for quarter and state** to make the dashboard interactive.

5. **Insights Extraction**
   - Identified top-performing states and customers.
   - Analyzed category-wise and sub-category-wise performance.
   - Observed seasonal trends in profit (Jan–Mar).
   - Studied payment mode preferences.

6. **Business Recommendations**
   - Promote high-profit categories (Printers, Phones).
   - Increase prepaid payment adoption to reduce COD dependency.
   - Retain high-value customers via loyalty programs.
   - Launch campaigns in months with lower profit.
